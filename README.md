# Warehouse Wreckage
In order to learn about Unreal Engine 5, I enrolled in a GameDev.tv course on the basics of Unreal Engine 5. The first project was a shooting range game to learn more about the engine and use blueprint to create projectiles and affect the physics of the barrels for when they are hit. As result I created a very short game where the goal is to knock over as any barrels as you can with the limited amount of ammo given and design the layout of the barrels.

Though it is not much, I wanted to use this project to learn about the engine and familiarize myslef with its features get a feel for blueprint and return to the project to polish the game and add features like moving targets, power ups, arenas and more. But for now I only wanted to use this as a means to showcase what I have learned so far in my journey as a game devloper.
