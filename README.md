# WarehouseWreckage
A mini shooting range game where the goal is to knock over as many barrels as possible.
The purpose of the game is to familiarize myself with the Unreal Engine, its physics simulations and Blueprint. As I can continue to learn more about Unreal and C++ I plan to add more features such as UI, Power Ups and work my way to build a rail shooter.
